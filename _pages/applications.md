Current collaborations
----------------------
In 2020, we started a spin-out company [Infinite, Biomedical Technologies](http://www.infinite-biotech.com), devoted to animal-free safety testing of nanomaterials and chemicals. We are excited to pursue this joint journey to bridge all TRL levels from basic science to the final product/service.
