Our vision
----------
By an indenpendent way of thinking beyond established paradigms we unravel new mechanisms of interactions between materials and living biological systems. Employing creative problem solving we develop new expertise-driven solutions. 
 
Join us to understand the molecular world and create advanced concepts in medical diagnostics, therapy, and biotechnology.


Our capacities
--------------
We are an interdisciplinary, highly motivated, and internationally established [team](/team/) with expertise in biophysics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and engineering. 

We work in a recently renovated and fully equipped clean cell laboratory, chemical laboratory, and a modern optical facility with super-resolution microscopy/nanoscopy. [Read more](/resources/)


Our achievements
----------------
In 2020, we started a spin-out company [Infinite Biotech](http://www.infinite-biotech.com) for animal-free safety testing of nanomaterials and chemicals.
