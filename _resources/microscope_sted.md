The state-of-the-art modular 2-photon super-resolution 3D STED microscope, custom-built by [Abberior Instruments](https://abberior-instruments.com/), is equiped with several exciation and detection modalities for live-cell imaging of supramolecular structures on the scales down to 30 nm. 

Tech details:  
* Olympus body with several objectives, table, piezo controlled stage, LED widefield illumination  
* Abberior modular fully-software-controlled 3D STED system with  
* high-power Ti-Saph tunable wavelength 150 fs pulsed excitation laser source snychronized with  
* two fixed wavelengths 100 ps pulsed excitation laser sources and  
* fixed wavelength ns pulsed depletion laser  
* with 2 single-photon counters (avalanche photodiodes -APDs) as the main detectors with deadtime below 25 ns and  
* 16-channel PMT with diffraction grading and B&H FLIM module for spectrally-resolved FLIM detection 
* any crossection of the coordinates x,y,z,t,tau,lambda possible with any of the combination of the following modalities: CF, 2D-3D STED, FLIM, spFLIM 
* flexible setup allows addition of new laser sources 
* flexible setup with incubation chamber for microscope-table
