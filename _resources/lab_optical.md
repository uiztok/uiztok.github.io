Optical setups are placed in the clean optical laboratory (ISO 6) together with modular platform for development of medical diagnostic technologies to ensure controllable and adaptable measurement environment. A small preparation lab enables final modification of the samples before optical measurements. 

Tech details:  
* flow-based clean room of 48 square meters with HEPA air filtration (ISO 6 class)  
* 3 optical platforms (2PE STED mwFLIM, FMS+OT, modular platform for the development of photonics technologies)  
* standard technical lines (water, pressurized air, nitrogen, CO2, Ar)  
* sample storage and freezer  
* large set of optical components and tools  
* SoP for sample transfers and people flow  
* NFC access control
