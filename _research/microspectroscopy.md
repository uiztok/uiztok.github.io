In brief
--------
We develop and apply spectrally resolved microscopy with environment-sensitive fluorescent dyes to characterise local environment of the probes and thereby detect molecular interactions. By custom spectral fitting routines, we can typically resolve spectral shifts as low as 1 nm, which gives us high sensitivity to differences in local molecular environment. 

We have applied the technique in various fields:
* to characterise properties of cellular membranes
* to detect interactions of nanomaterials with biological systems
* to detect bacteria on nanomaterial-coated surfaces
* for temperature measurements in microboiling
* ...

This project greatly benefits from our fruitful collaboration on the development of [environment-sensitive probes](/research/probes), also compatible with super-resolution STED microscopy.
