Focus

We develop optical methods for diagnostics and therapy of ophthalmologic diseases. Recently, we have led two applied research projects:

* Microspectroscopy-based optimization of the effects of laser pulses on the retina (ARRS L7-7561)
* Spatio-temporal shaping of laser light for minimally invasive ophthalmological procedures (ARRS L2-9254)
