In brief
--------
We are introducing adaptive acquisition schemes and computer vision algorithms to improve the efficiency of advanced optical techniques and reduce operators' bias in the collected data. Within a national research project ARRS J7-2596, we collaborate with 
* [Visual Cognitive Systems Laboratory](http://www.vicos.si) from the Faculty of Computer and Information Science, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia
* [dr. Dominic Waithe](https://dwaithe.github.io/home/) from the MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, UK.
