In brief
--------
A definitive conclusion about the dangers associated with human or animal exposure to a particular nanomaterial can currently be made upon complex and costly procedures including complete characterisation of nanomaterials with consequent careful and well-controlled *in vivo* experiments. To advance the nanotoxicity prediction, we use *in vivo*, *in vitro* and *in silico* research, combined with systems biology and statistical methods, to address main respiratory toxicity pathways for a representative set of nanomaterials, to identify the mechanistic key events of the pathways, and to relate them to interactions at the bio-nano interface.  

Using this knowledge, economic and straightforward tests will be developed to assess the ability of nanomaterial to produce the pathway-relevant key events. This approach will allow us to group materials based on their nanotoxicity and identify properties of concern for new materials, as well as reduce the need for expensive nanotoxicity testing in the future. 

Pursuing this vision, we started a spin out company [Infinite Biotech](http://www.infinite-biotech.com), where we further develop alternative safety tests that can help the industry, regulators, and society. From 2023, we also coordinate a Horizon Europe project [nanoPASS](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101092741) with 9 partners from 7 countries.
