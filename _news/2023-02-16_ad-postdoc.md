We are searching for a talented and motivated postdoc to join our team and work on the newly started EU project [*nanoPASS*](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101092741)! The project is devoted to the development of new methods for safety testing of nanomaterials, which will be faster, cheaper and more reliable than *in vivo* tests. Our greatest challenge is to predict slowly developing diseases, such as lung fibrosis, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration.
