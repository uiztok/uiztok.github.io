[Aleksandar SebastijanoviÄ‡](/team/SebastijanovicAleksandar) defended his PhD thesis *"In Vitro-Detected Early Events to Unravel Sporadic Neurodegeneration"* today at the *Jozef Stefan International Postgraduate School*! It was a joy to witness such a rich discussion - going both deep into mechanisms as well as broad into implications. 

Aleks is now fueling the R&D at the spin-out company [Infinite Biotech](https://www.infinite-biotech.com).
