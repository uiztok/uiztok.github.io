Today we launched the EU project [*nanoPASS*](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101092741) that we coordinate! 

The project is devoted to the development of new methods for safety testing of nanomaterials, which will be faster, cheaper and more reliable than *in vivo* tests. Our greatest challenge is to predict slowly developing diseases, such as lung fibrosis, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration.

It was great to see that all 9 partners from across Europe are excited to contribute their complementary expertise from computer simulations, material science, biophysics and microscopy, single-cell omics, intravital imaging, to *in vivo* toxicology and workplace health assessment - we will need them all!

P.S.: Vacancies opening soon!
