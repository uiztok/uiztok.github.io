Following my work on H2020 SmartNanoTox project I am currently performing research in the field of Nanotoxicology and Pulmonary Surfactant as a PhD student. I strive to improve current definition of nanomaterial dose and the understanding of the influence of pulmonary surfactant on nanomaterial interactions in lung model systems.

I am inspired by unraveling relevant questions using combination of advanced optical imaging techniques (STED, FLIM, time-resolved microscopy), microscope programming and automatization coupled with advanced image analysis.
