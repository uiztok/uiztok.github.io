For my MSc thesis in LBF, I studied the influence of TiO2 nanoparticles on the mechanical response of epithelial cells to osmotic shocks. 

Now I am excited to start my PhD studies at the [Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics](https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research-groups/current-groups/jan-brugues/) in Dresden, Germany.
