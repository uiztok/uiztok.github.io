I am conducting research in the field of (Predictive) Nanotoxicology: 
I wish to pinpoint the key molecular events in the interaction of nanomaterial and cells, understand how they lead to diseases, and devise simple tests to predict them. 

I enjoy combining advanced optical imaging (STED, FLIM, 2PE, hyperspectral imaging, ...), image analysis and biophysical knowledge with complementary approaches to provide unique insights into cell biology and pathology.

My recently defended PhD Thesis was titled "Investigating the early molecular events following exposure of lung cells to nanoparticles using advanced optical microscopies"
