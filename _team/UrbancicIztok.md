*I am deeply fascinated by the incredible orchestration of life across vastly different spatiotemporal scales, which drives me in the quest to unravel the molecular mechanisms of cellular processes. I am convinced that the biophysical approach, together with advanced optical microscopy and spectroscopy techniques, can offer a powerful toolbox in solving this great puzzle.*
