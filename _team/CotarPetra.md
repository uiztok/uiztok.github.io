As a PhD student conducting research in the field of (Predictive) Nanotoxicology, 
I wish to pinpoint the key molecular events in the interactions between nanomaterials and cells, 
understand how they lead to diseases, and devise simple tests to predict them. 

I enjoy combining advanced live-cell optical imaging 
(STED, FLIM, 2-photon microscopy, hyperspectral imaging, ...), 
image analysis and quantification, modelling, and testing newly-designed fluorescent probes with 
complementary approaches to resolve burning issues, as we successfully 
accomplished in the H2020 project SmartNanoTox.
