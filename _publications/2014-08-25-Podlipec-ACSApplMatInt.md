In brief 
--------
The scope of our study was thus the investigation of the correlation of fibroblast cell growth on different gelatin scaffolds with their morphological, mechanical as well as surface molecular properties. 
In this study, anisotropy of the rotational motion of the gelatin side chain mobility was identified as the most correlated quantity with cell growth in the first days after adhesion, 
while weaker correlations were found with scaffold viscoelasticity and no correlations with scaffold morphology.
