In brief 
--------
In our study, we present a proof-of-concept development of an algorithm to quantify laser-induced tissue changes on the basis of fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence intensity parameters. Using this algorithm, 
we can monitor and control the degree of laser-induced damage during theranostic procedures in real time.
