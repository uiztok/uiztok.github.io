In brief 
--------
Here we show that copper doped TiO2 nanotubes produce about five times more ·OH radicals as compared to undoped TiO2 nanotubes and that effective surface disinfection, determined by a modified ISO 22196:2011 test, 
can be achieved even at low intensity UVA light of 30 μW/cm2. The nanotubes can be deposited on a preformed surface at room temperature, resulting in a stable deposition resistant to multiple washings. 
Up to 103 microorganisms per cm2 can be inactivated in 24 hours, including resistant strains such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli (E. coli ESBL).
