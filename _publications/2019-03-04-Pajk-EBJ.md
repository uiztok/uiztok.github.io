In brief 
--------
We designed and tested several new orange and red fluorescent probes for live-cell STED nanoscopy. 
Three of the newly-synthesized probes exhibited improved resolution in STED nanoscopy with a 775 nm STED laser and
two of these were also remarkably photostable, thus being perfectly suited for STED nanoscopy. 
The best overall results were assigned to the probe MePyr500, which was also not cytotoxic, making it an excellent candidate for live-cell STED nanoscopy.
