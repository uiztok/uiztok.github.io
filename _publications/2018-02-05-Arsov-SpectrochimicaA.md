In brief 
--------
Generating activatable probes that report about molecular vicinity through contact-based mechanisms such as aggregation can be very convenient. 
Specifically, such probes change a particular spectral property only at the intended biologically relevant target. 
In this work, we show that the size of the aggregation-induced emission spectral shift at specific position on the sample can be measured by fluorescence microspectroscopy, 
which at particular pH allows estimation of the local concentration of the observed probe at microscopic level.
