In brief 
--------
The prediction of diseases associated with nanomaterials is currently hampered by an incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Together with  international collaborators, we discovered nanomaterial quarantining and counteracting nanomaterial cycling, which allowed us to incorporate these main modes of cellular response into a mechanistic model and predict in vivo inflammation solely on animal-free in vitro tests. The paper was published in the prestigious journal *Advanced Materials* and selected as the [frontispiece](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.202070353) of the journal issue.
