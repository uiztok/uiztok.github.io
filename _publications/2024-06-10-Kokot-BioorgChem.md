In brief 
--------
We synthesized and characterized a novel amphiphilic fluorescent label SHE-2N, which enables quick and long-lasting fluorescent labeling of the outer cell membranes of living cells. This new label for fluorescence microscopy is also suitable for high-resolution STED microscopy and two-photon microscopy due to its high photostability and appropriate spectral characteristics.
