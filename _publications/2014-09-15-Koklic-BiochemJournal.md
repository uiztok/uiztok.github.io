In brief 
--------
In the present study, we show that overall fXa activity on PS-containing membranes is sharply regulated by a ‘Ca2+ switch’ centred at 1.16 mM, below which fXa is active and above which fXa forms 
inactive dimers on PS-exposing membranes. Our data lead to a mathematical model that predicts the variation of fXa activity as a function of both Ca2+ and membrane concentrations. 
Because the critical Ca2+ concentration is at the lower end of the normal plasma ionized Ca2+ concentration range, we propose a new regulatory mechanism by which local Ca2+ concentration switches fXa 
from an intrinsically active form to a form requiring its cofactor [fVa (Factor Va)] to achieve significant activity.
