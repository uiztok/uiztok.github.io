In brief 
--------
In our work, compact fiber-laser based on high-speed gain-switched laser diode has been shown to achieve adaptable/independently tunable repetition rate and energy per pulse 
allowing coupled fluorescence lifetime ophthalmic diagnostics via two-photon excitation and phototherapy via laser-induced photodisruption on a local molecular environment in a complex ex vivo retinal tissue.
