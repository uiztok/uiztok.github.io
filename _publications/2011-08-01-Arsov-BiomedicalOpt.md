In brief 
--------
Here we present a development of fluorescence microspectroscopy (spectral imaging) based on a white light spinning disk confocal microscope with emission wavelength selection by a liquid crystal tunable filter. 
Spectral contrasting of images was used to localize polymer nanoparticles and cell membranes labeled with fluorophores that have substantially overlapping spectra. 
In addition, fluorescence microspectroscopy enabled spatially-resolved detection of small but significant effects of local molecular environment on the properties of environment-sensitive fluorescent probe.
