In brief 
--------
We characterized the influence of three different detachment procedures: cell scraping by rubber policeman, trypsinization and a citrate buffer treatment on V-79 cells in the plateau phase of growth (arrested in G1). 
We found out that cell viability was 91% for trypsin treatment, 85% for citrate treatment and 70% for cell scraping.
