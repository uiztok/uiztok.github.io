In brief 
--------
To characterize the structure of dynamic protein systems, such as partly disordered protein complexes, we propose a novel approach that relies on a combination of site-directed spin-labeled 
electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and modeling of local rotation conformational spaces. We applied this approach to the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein
and provided a mechanistic explanation for the high affinity of the binding reaction between the measles virus and the viral phosphoprotein.
