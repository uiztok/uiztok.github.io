In brief 
--------
In our study, optical tweezers combined with confocal fluorescence microscopy were optimized to investigate the initial cell–scaffold contact and to investigate its correlation with the material-dependent cell growth. 
We have shown that dynamics of cell adhesion on scaffold surfaces correlates with cell growth on the days scale, which indicates that the first seconds of the contact could markedly direct further cell response and 
predict scaffold biocompatibility.
