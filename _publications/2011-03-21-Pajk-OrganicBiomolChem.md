In brief 
--------
A serious drawback of ESR, particularly in its application to cells, is the lack of information on the location of spin probes in the system. In order to realize real time tracking, 
a spin probe was combined with a fluorophore in a new kind of nitroxide–fluorophore double probe which, in addition to information about lipid dynamics, enables visualization by fluorescence microscopy.
